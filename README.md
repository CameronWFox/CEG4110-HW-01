Class: CEG 4110-01 Intro to Software Engineering
Project Assignment: Homework 1
Project Name: # CEG4110-HW-01
Student Name: Cameron Windsor Fox
This is the first homework project assignment for my CEG 4110 class of my Senior Year at Wright State University.

Purpose of Application:
This application is composed of two parts; 

Part 1, create a UI where you can input the name of a color or any text in a text box, then when you click a button it will randomly change the color of the text of whatever you just entered on the application.

Part 2, you must create a second UI on this application that contains a canvas that will let you draw on the screen with your finger. In addition to painting in the canvas, you must also be abl eto do the following:
1. Clear the Canvas to start a new drawing by the use of a button.
2. When you finish your drawing you must be able to save this image of the canvas in either a png file or jpeg file format. 

Including these two parts to the assignment you need to implement a way of navigating between both UI elements to travel back and forth if if the user chooses to do so. 

For my build of the assignment here is my display and how to use the application.
Phase 01:
Figure 1.0 shows the application when you first start it up.
